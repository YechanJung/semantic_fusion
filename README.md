# Semantic Fusion Example Code

This repository contains example code for the Semantic Fusion approach described in our paper "Semantic Fusion: Treating Model Outputs as Distinct Modalities in Reinforcement Learning." The code demonstrates how to implement our theoretical framework in a reinforcement learning setting.

## Approach Overview

Semantic Fusion proposes treating perception model outputs as separate modalities from physical state information in reinforcement learning. Instead of simply concatenating these different types of information, our approach processes them through specialized encoders before fusion using a cross-modal attention mechanism.

## Example Implementation

The provided code demonstrates how Semantic Fusion can be integrated with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). This is a conceptual implementation to illustrate the key components of our approach:

1. **Separate processing paths** for physical state and perception model outputs
2. **Cross-modal attention mechanism** for adaptive fusion of information
3. **End-to-end training** with a standard RL algorithm

## Key Components

```python
# Physical State Encoder
class PhysicalStateEncoder(nn.Module):
    # Processes physical state information (position, velocity, etc.)
    
# Semantic Output Encoder
class SemanticOutputEncoder(nn.Module):
    # Processes outputs from perception models (detections, confidences, etc.)
    
# Cross-Modal Attention
class CrossModalAttention(nn.Module):
    # Adaptively weights and fuses information from both modalities
    
# Complete PPO Implementation with Semantic Fusion
class SemanticFusionPPO(nn.Module):
    # Integrates the specialized encoders and fusion mechanism
```

## Usage Notes

This code is provided as a reference implementation of the concepts described in our paper. It is not intended as a production-ready library but rather as an illustration of how the Semantic Fusion approach can be implemented.

Researchers interested in applying this approach to their own work should adapt the code to their specific environments and requirements.

## Paper Abstract

> This paper presents Semantic Fusion, a novel paradigm for treating perception model outputs as distinct modalities in reinforcement learning. Traditional approaches concatenate perception outputs with physical state, whereas our method processes them independently before fusion. Using conditional mutual information analysis, we establish the theoretical validity of this approach and propose an architecture that offers potential advantages in modularity, interpretability, and scalability. The framework provides a foundation for more effective integration of perception models in reinforcement learning systems.
